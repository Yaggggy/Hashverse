## 🔑 What is Hashing?

Hashing is the process of converting data of **any size** into a **fixed-size string** (usually a hexadecimal number) using a mathematical function called a **hash function**.

- **One-way function**: You cannot easily reverse a hash to get the original input.
- **Fixed-size output**: No matter how long the input is, the hash has a fixed length.
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same hash.
- **Avalanche effect**: Small changes in input produce drastically different hashes.

Hashing is widely used in:

- Password storage (never store raw passwords!)
- Data integrity verification
- Digital signatures
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency

## 🛠️ Popular Hash Algorithms

| Algorithm   | Output Size             | Summary                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MD5**     | 128-bit (32 hex chars)  | Fast and widely used for checksums, but **not secure** for cryptography anymore due to collisions. |
| **SHA-1**   | 160-bit (40 hex chars)  | Older cryptographic hash, better than MD5, but also **no longer secure** for sensitive data.       |
| **SHA-256** | 256-bit (64 hex chars)  | Part of SHA-2 family. Highly secure and widely used for blockchain and certificates.               |
| **SHA-512** | 512-bit (128 hex chars) | Strongest of SHA-2 family. Used for high-security applications.                                    |
| **SHA-384** | 384-bit (96 hex chars)  | Truncated version of SHA-512, offers high security with smaller output.                            |

## 🚀 How HashVerse Works

1. User enters input text.
2. User selects a hashing algorithm.
3. Frontend sends request to FastAPI backend.
4. Backend computes the hash using Python’s `hashlib` module.
5. Result is returned to frontend along with a short explanation of the selected algorithm.
6. Frontend displays hash and algorithm summary in a clean, dark-themed UI.
